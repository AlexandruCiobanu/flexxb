#summary Overview of the basic XML communication service and object persistence support available in FlexXB
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Besides the powerful xml processing capabilities, FlexXB also offers support for communicating with the server as well as the notion of persistable objects.

=== Server communication ===

Having the ability to convert ActionScript objects to xml and vice versa is quite redundant if not for a means of communicating with the back end server consuming and producing the xml request and responses.
FlexXB offers server communication capabilities by the classes located in {{{com.googlecode.flex.service}}}. They are enumerated below along with a description of their purpose:

* {{{ITranslator}}} - 
* {{{ICommunicator}}} - 
* {{{Communicator}}} - 
* {{{AbstractService}}} - 
* {{{ServiceSettings}}} - 
* {{{SettingsChangedEvent}}} -
