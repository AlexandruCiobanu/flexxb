#summary Customizing and extending FlexXB 2.x
#labels Phase-Implementation

FlexXB offers several extension points: 
 * Implement specialised interfaces in your model objects to modify the engine's behavior on serialization/deserialization;
 * Create a custom serialization context in order to define a new format for serializing (JSON, binary, etc.)
 * Create a custom serializer;
 * Create a custom annotation along with its own serializer;
 * Create custom classes for your annotations to be used in the Annotation API to markup classes without having to manually specify metadatas in the source code.
