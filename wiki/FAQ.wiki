== 1. Specifying member type xxx for array annotations results in a _Error #1065: xxx variable is not defined_ ==

*Cause:* 

This problem might appear on all list-like fields in class definitions if the type of the list members is not used anywhere else in the application. The Flex compiler will ignore class definitions that are not explicitly used in the application, thus the #1065 will appear if FlexXB attempts to deserialize the specific object.

*Resolution:*

To solve this problem do one of the following:

 * Use objects of type xxx somewhere in the application;
 * Add [ArrayElementType("xxx")] annotation on the array field;
 * Explicitly include the xxx type at compile time by adding include-classes attribute in the compiler arguments.

*Example:*

{{{
public class Section implements IIdentifiable
{
	[XmlAttribute]
	public var id : String;

	[XmlArray(alias="units",type="model.Unit")]
        [ArrayElementType("model.Unit")]
	public var units : Array;
}
}}}

*Resolution:*

Set an environmental variable named SystemDrive with value _C:_
